# Auto Claims Image Classification
## Fall 2024 CMSE 492 project
### Landon Buskirk

Many insurance companies must manage thousands of claims each year. Furthermore, insurance fraud is a large obstacle for these companies, and so claims often have to be analyzed diligently by hand.
My project aims to create a model to classify images of car damage as a common type of auto claim (dent, flat tire, broken glass, etc). Predictions can help speed up claims analysis and fraud detection.


Project objectives:
- 
- explore various architectures of convolutional neural networks
- create a report with a clear narrative
